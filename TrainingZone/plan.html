  <h1> Project Plan</h1>
  <h1> Mini Site 2 - Training Zone</h1>
  <p>&lt;Aiden Low jc374414&gt; </p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
  <p>Summarise what the project is and why (purpose) in one or two concise
  paragraphs. Note that the mission must be to improve something in a measurable way.<br>
  To &quot;provide information about something&quot; is not a good mission, since you can't see a measurable improvement. Why is the site needed? </p>
  <p>The Training Zone web site is intended to  increase revenue for Training Zone by promoting the services offered by the  company and increasing new and repeat customers.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> Discuss the process(es) by which the site's success will be evaluated. Note that a &quot;hit counter&quot; only counts people (or robots) visiting your web site; it says nothing about whether the site has achieved its mission. How do you know that the site does what the client wanted? Measure the mission.</p>
<p>Other advertising will be consistent for a period of 3 months (except for  including the new web site), so that any increase in sales should be  attributable to the site. At the end of this 3 month period (and during), the  number of new customers will be counted and compared to the previous 3 months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Describe the target audience your site is intended for (be specific; you can't aim for &quot;everyone&quot;), why they were chosen and<em> <strong>how</strong> you
    will specifically design the site  to cater to them</em>.</p>
<p>Local residents,  mostly between the ages of 28 and 50 form the majority of our current audience  (mature age job seekers), and this is who the site is aimed at. (This means that a mature audience will be more prone to reading information).</p>
<h2>Site Flowchart (Structure Diagram)</h2>
<p>    Insert image here (GIF or PNG are normally the best format choice if doing a plain, straight-lined diagram). Use arrows to show link direction. You might consider using <a href="http://draw.io" target="_blank">draw.io</a> if you don't have a preferred flowchart drawing program.</p>

<p>Contact information will be on every page in a footer</p>
